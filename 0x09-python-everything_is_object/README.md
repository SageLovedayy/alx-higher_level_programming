# 0x09-python-everything_is_object

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts and text files that demonstrate various concepts related to object-oriented programming and the nature of objects in Python.

## Environment
All scripts are designed to be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.8.5). Additionally, the Pycodestyle tool (version 2.8.*) is used for code style checks.

## Usage
To run any of the scripts, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 script_name.py
```

Ensure that you have the correct Python version installed on your system.

## Code Style
The scripts adhere to the Pycodestyle guidelines to maintain a consistent and clean code style. Pycodestyle checks can be performed using the following command:

```bash
pycodestyle script_name.py
```
